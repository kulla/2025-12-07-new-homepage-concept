# Hi there! I'm Kulla, a software developer and educator

## My Vision

### Maximizing Positive Impact

The most rewarding and motivating part of my work is receiving genuine feedback
on how much it has helped others. I strive to invest my finite time, knowledge,
and skill to create the greatest possible positive impact for as many people as
I can.

### Translating the Abstract into Shared Clarity

So much of what shapes our world is rooted in abstract concepts. What excites me
is (re)discovering and understanding the core _why_ behind the curtain of
abstraction. I enjoy turning these insights into clear explanations that help
others feel that same spark of clarity.

## Some of my work principles

### Work Should Energize

Work is a major part of life, so it should lift you up rather than drain you. If
it doesn’t, it’s a signal worth paying attention to — perhaps it’s time to
reconnect with the deeper purpose behind the work or reconsider the environment
in which it happens.

### Be Grateful and Give Back

Everything we build rests on the work of others. Nowhere is this more visible
than in software development, where so much depends on open‑source
contributions. Remembering this fosters gratitude and inspires us to give
something meaningful back to the communities that make our work possible.

### Achieve Together

Big visions become real when people unite around them. Working together
multiplies what’s possible and leads to results none of us could achieve on our
own.

### Embrace the Gray

Few things are black‑and‑white; the world is full of nuance. Embracing this
complexity encourages humility and a more open perspective.

## Some of my projects

### Serlo Editor

A collaborative WYSIWYG framework for structured documents that unifies the
strengths of rich‑text editors and schema‑based content. Through my work in the
educational field, I identified a significant gap: while WYSIWYG editors like
Lexical or ProseMirror offer excellent usability and collaboration, they lack
support for structured content (such as exercises consisting of a question and
an answer). Form‑based tools like H5P enable structured educational material,
yet fall behind in user experience and do not support real‑time editing. By
combining both worlds, this framework empowers educators and other professionals
to create high‑quality materials with ease.

### Serlo Plattform

Serlo.org is a free and open learning platform designed to make high-quality
education accessible to everyone. A central part of Serlo’s vision is to provide
an inclusive, distraction-free learning environment that supports students at
different skill levels. Similar to Wikipedia, the platform is community-driven,
and all content is freely accessible as open educational material.

During my work at Serlo, I served as Team Lead for up to twelve software
developers and was responsible for the development and maintenance of the entire
platform. The technical stack includes a TypeScript-based environment with a
GraphQL API powered by Apollo on the backend, and a modern frontend built with
React and Next.js.

### Open textbooks "Mathe für Nicht-Freaks"

Mathe für Nicht‑Freaks is an open, community-driven mathematics textbook created
with the vision that all students should be able to make a confident and
successful transition from school to university-level mathematics. I founded the
project during my studies after seeing how many students struggled with the
shift toward abstraction, formal reasoning, and proof-based thinking.

The project’s didactic approach centers on making abstract mathematics genuinely
understandable by uncovering and explaining the core intuition behind each
concept. Instead of overwhelming learners with formalism, the material builds
understanding step by step, using motivation, clear explanations, and
well-structured examples. The goal is not merely to teach computational
techniques, but to help students develop real conceptual insight—so they can
think mathematically rather than simply follow formal procedures.
