# Hi there! I'm Kulla, a software developer and educator

## My Vision

### Maximizing Positive Impact

The most rewarding and motivating part of my work is receiving genuine feedback
on how much it has helped others. I strive to invest my finite time, knowledge,
and skill to create the greatest possible positive impact for as many people as
I can.

### Translating the Abstract into Shared Clarity

So much of what shapes our world is rooted in abstract concepts. What excites me
is (re)discovering and understanding the core _why_ behind the curtain of
abstraction. I enjoy turning these insights into clear explanations that help
others feel that same spark of clarity.

## Some of my work principles

### Work Should Energize

Work is a major part of life, so it should lift you up rather than drain you. If
it doesn’t, it’s a signal worth paying attention to — perhaps it’s time to
reconnect with the deeper purpose behind the work or reconsider the environment
in which it happens.

### Be Grateful and Give Back

Everything we build rests on the work of others. Nowhere is this more visible
than in software development, where so much depends on open‑source
contributions. Remembering this fosters gratitude and inspires us to give
something meaningful back to the communities that make our work possible.

### Achieve Together

Big visions become real when people unite around them. Working together
multiplies what’s possible and leads to results none of us could achieve on our
own.

### Embrace the Gray

Few things are black‑and‑white; the world is full of nuance. Embracing this
complexity encourages humility and a more open perspective.

## Some of my projects

### Serlo Editor

A collaborative WYSIWYG framework for structured documents that unifies the
strengths of rich‑text editors and schema‑based content. Through my work in the
educational field, I identified a significant gap: while WYSIWYG editors like
Lexical or ProseMirror offer excellent usability and collaboration, they lack
support for structured content (such as exercises consisting of a question and
an answer). Form‑based tools like H5P enable structured educational material,
yet fall behind in user experience and do not support real‑time editing. By
combining both worlds, this framework empowers educators and other professionals
to create high‑quality materials with ease.
