# Hi there! I'm Kulla, a software developer and educator

## I want to help people with the software I create

The most motivating and rewarding part of my work is when people genuinely tell
or write to me about how much my work has helped them. I strive to invest my
limited time on earth, knowledge, and skill to create a positive impact for as
many people as possible.

### Example: Creating a WYSIWYG editor for educational content
