# Hi there! I'm Kulla, a software developer and educator

## I want to help people with the software I create

The most motivating and rewording part of my work is when people genuinely tell
or write me how much my work has helped them. I thrieve to invest my limited
time on earth, knowledge and skill to create a prositive impact for as many
people as possible.

### Example: Creating a WYSIWYG editor for educational content
