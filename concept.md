## My Vision

### Maximizing Positive Impact

The most rewarding and motivating part of my work is receiving genuine feedback
on how much it has helped others. I strive to invest my finite time, knowledge,
and skill to create the greatest possible positive impact for as many people as
I can.

is (re)discovering and understanding the core _why_ behind the curtain of
abstraction. I enjoy turning these insights into clear explanations that help
others feel that same spark of clarity.
