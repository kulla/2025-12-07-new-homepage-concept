# Hi there! I'm Kulla, a software developer and educator

## My Vision

### I want to help people with the software I create

The most motivating and rewarding part of my work is when people genuinely tell
or write to me about how much my work has helped them. I strive to invest my
limited time on earth, knowledge, and skill to create a positive impact for as
many people as possible.

### I want to find and share the intuition behind abstract concepts

Most of the technological and scientific advancements that have shaped our world
are built on abstract concepts. However, only if one understands their
underlying intuition – the why and how behind these concepts – can one truly
leverage their power. I feel a great joy to (re)discover the motivation and
intuition behind abstract concepts and share them with overs in sticking and
motivating stories.
