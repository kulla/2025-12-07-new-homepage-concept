# Hi there! I'm Kulla, a software developer and educator

## My Vision

### I want to help people with the software I create

The most motivating and rewarding part of my work is when people genuinely tell
or write to me about how much my work has helped them. I strive to invest my
limited time on earth, knowledge, and skill to create a positive impact for as
many people as possible.

### I want to find and share the intuition behind abstract concepts

So much of what shapes our world is rooted in abstract concepts. What excites me
is (re)discovering and understanding the core _why_ behind the curtain of
abstraction. I enjoy turning these insights into clear explanations that help
others feel that same spark of clarity.
